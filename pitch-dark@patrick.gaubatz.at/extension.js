 * It is often in the window's title, being `"0x%x %10s".format(XID, window.title)`.
 * (See `mutter/src/core/window-props.c`).
 *
 * If we couldn't find it there, we use `win`'s actor, `win.get_compositor_private()`.
 * The actor's `x-window` property is the X ID of the window *actor*'s frame
 * (as opposed to the window itself).
 *
 * However, the child window of the window actor is the window itself, so by
 * using `xwininfo -children -id [actor's XID]` we can attempt to deduce the
 * window's X ID.
 *
 * It is not always foolproof, but works good enough for now.
 *
 * @param {Meta.Window} win - the window to guess the XID of. You wil get better
 * success if the window's actor (`win.get_compositor_private()`) exists.
